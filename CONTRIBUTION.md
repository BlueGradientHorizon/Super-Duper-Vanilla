## Basic Guidelines
   Important standards that must be followed when contributing to this project.

### Testing
   Do not submit your PR without running Minecraft with the shader on and making sure no issues come out.

### Compatibility
   If you're making a pull request for mod compatibility, please make sure your fix does not affect other fixes from other mods.

### Optimization
   Please check if your code performs well and try to optimize it as much as possible.

### Translation
   For translation, it should be based from the latest commit to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts, and that another person fluent for the language you're translating to should verify the final product. Please also keep the same text format as the main language file [en_US](/lang/en_US.lang).

   If you're updating an existing translation, the same rules will apply unless someone is already working on it. If that were the case, please communicate with the user working on the translation before making a pull request.
   
## Style guidelines
* No spaces around parentheses: `if(condition){`, `this = function()`
* Use `camelCase` on everything, including constants.
* Use `SCREAMING_CASE` for defined macros only.

## Miscellaneous
   You may add your name in [**CONTRIBUTORS**](CONTRIBUTORS.md) under the contributers list with your PR. If you're a translator, add your name under the translators list.

## TO DO: (for Eldeston)
   Update the descriptions of this file.
   Make a separate file for translation.
